# Stellar Invasion

![](layout.jpg)

## Overview

Your species is faced with a harsh reality: prosper or perish.

To prosper, your species must conquer planets scattered throughout the system. Some of these planets are more desirable than others. Some have already been conquered, and require an offensive to rid the planet of the competing colony.

If you fail to prosper, you **will** be invaded. Spread too slowly, and you'll fail to amass the army necessary for a proper defense. Spread out too quickly and you'll leave your defenses spread thin, allowing an enemy to quickly conquer your citizenship.

## Citizen Units

Each wooden block represents 1 citizen unit. 1 citizen unit is equal to a good number of citizens; not too big to transport between planets, but big enough to take care of themselves as they colonize planets and fight enemies.

## Initial Colonization

The game starts by populating the system. Each player begins with 40 citizen units to settle the planets. 

Settling requires defeating the natives, but only at half the rate. For example, if you want to settle a large planet, you will loose X/2 of your citizens in the process (half the normal amount of X).

## Turns

Turns are compromised of each player moving their CUs around the board 3 times. 

### Turn Order

On your turn, each player may move up to 3 times (both passive movement and attacking). If the player so desires, they may complete their turn without taking all 3 movement opportunities. 

### Passive Movement

Citizens are allowed to move to any colonized planet 

### Attacking Movement

You may move your citizens to any adjascent planet that you do no currently own. This is considered an attack, as you'll either be fighting natives or attacking another player.

## Conquering Planets

### Natives

Unoccupied planets have natives that you must quell in order to inhabit. Native do not benefit from the defense bonus (e.g. to conquer a planet with 8 natives, you'll need at least 8 citizen units), therefore it's a straight 1:1 cost. 

### Occupied Planets

Each conquered planet provides 1 defense to the player who currently inhabits it. To defeat an occupying force, you'll have to attack with at least 1 more than currently live on the plant. 

Example: if you have a planet with 8 CU's on it, and I attack with 10, then I win the planet and have 1 CU left living on the planet.

## Planets

The big red dots are big planets, the slightly smaller ones are medium planets, and the small blue dots are small planets.

Each planet has three attributes:

- Prosperity
- Natives
- Population Limit

### Prosperity

At the end of each complete turn (3 moves completed for each player), colonized planets will grow in population according to their prosperity value.

- Low prosperity planets grow x per turn.
- Medium prosperity planets grow y per turn.
- High prosperity planets grow z per turn.

Unpopulated planets and those occupied by natives have no population growth.

### Natives 

All planets have natives living on them. Even conquered planets have natives (they're simply subdued). If an occupying force completely leaves the planet, any new attempts to conquer the planets require suppressing the natives again. 

(X people for big, Y for medium & Z for small)

### Population Limits

Each planet has a population limits, depending on its size. 

- Small planets are limited to 20 citizens.
- Medium planets are limited to 30 citizens.
- Large planets are limited to 60 citizens.
