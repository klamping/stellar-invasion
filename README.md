# Stellar Invasion

## Overview

Your species is faced with a harsh reality: prosper or perish.

To prosper, your species must conquer planets scattered throughout the system. Some of these planets are more desireable than others. Some have already been conquered, and require an offensive to rid the planet of the competing colony.

If you fail to prosper, you will be invaded. Spread too slowly, and you won't amass the army necessary for a proper defense. Grow too quickly and you'll 

- the goal is to kill all of your opponents citizens (or get them to surrender once they know they’ve lost)

## Pieces

- Each wooden block represents 1 citizen unit.

## Initial Colonization

The game starts with a space 

You begin with 40 citizen units to settle the planets. 

Settling requires defeating the natives, but only at half the rate. For example, if you want to settle a large planet, you will loose X/2 of your citizens in the process (half the normal amount of X).

## Turns

### Turn Order

###

- you get 3 moves per turn, where you can move any # of people to any adjacent planet



## Movement

## Conquering Planets

### Natives

- empty planets have natives that you first have to conquer (20 people for big, 5 for medium & 2 for small)


### Attacking

- fights are simple math... if you have a planet with 8 people on it, and I attack with 10, then I win the planet and have 1 citizen left living on the planet

### Defense

Each conquered planet provides 1 defense to the player who currently inhabits it. 

## Planets

The big red dots are big planets, the slightly smaller ones are medium planets, and the small blue dots are small planets.

Each planet has three attributes 

### Planetary Growth

Each turn, colonized planets will grow their population according to their size.

Small planets grow x per turn.
Medium planets grow y per turn.
Large planets grow z per turn.

Unpopulated planets and those occupied by natives have no population growth.

- you citizen count grows at the end of each turn, depending on the size of the planet (+8 for big, +4 for med and +1 for small)


### Population max

- there are also population limits on planets, depending on size of course
