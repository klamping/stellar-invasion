# Stellar Invasion

## Overview

Your species is faced with a harsh reality: prosper or perish.

To prosper, your species must conquer planets scattered throughout the system. Some of these planets are more desireable than others. Some have already been conquered, and require an offensive to rid the planet of the competing colony.

If you fail to prosper, you **will** be invaded. Spread too slowly, and you'll fail to amass the army necessary for a proper defense. Spread out too quickly and you'll leave your defenses spread thin, allowing an enemy to quickly conquer your citizenship.

## Pieces

- Each wooden block represents 1 citizen unit. 1 citizen unit is equal to a good number of citizens; not too big to transport between planets, but big enough to take care of themselves as they colonize planets.

## Initial Colonization

The game starts by populating the system. Each player begins with 40 citizen units to settle the planets. 

Settling requires defeating the natives, but only at half the rate. For example, if you want to settle a large planet, you will loose X/2 of your citizens in the process (half the normal amount of X).

## Turns

### Turn Order

On your turn, you may move up to 3 times (both passive movement and attacking).

### Passive Movement

Citizens are allowed to move to any colonized planet 

### Attacking Movement

You may move your citizens to any adjascent planet that you do no currently own. This is considered an attack, as you'll either be fighting natives or attacking another player.

## Movement



## Conquering Planets

### Natives

- empty planets have natives that you first have to conquer (20 people for big, 5 for medium & 2 for small)


### Attacking

- fights are simple math... if you have a planet with 8 people on it, and I attack with 10, then I win the planet and have 1 citizen left living on the planet

### Defense

Each conquered planet provides 1 defense to the player who currently inhabits it. 

## Planets

The big red dots are big planets, the slightly smaller ones are medium planets, and the small blue dots are small planets.

Each planet has three attributes 

### Planetary Growth

Each turn, colonized planets will grow their population according to their size.

Small planets grow x per turn.
Medium planets grow y per turn.
Large planets grow z per turn.

Unpopulated planets and those occupied by natives have no population growth.

- you citizen count grows at the end of each turn, depending on the size of the planet (+8 for big, +4 for med and +1 for small)


### Population max

- there are also population limits on planets, depending on size of course
